^ More specifically, _this_ is me.

^ Share a story about this summer

^ I was away from my own parents and also looking after children

^ We had a full 5 days of training and then we were set loose

^ 2nd day at dinner, kid – *Justin* – gets up and leaves the table.

^ Starts walking.

^ I got this.

^ I've got minutes upon minutes of experience with this sort of thing.

^ Justin keeps walking.

^ Where are you going? Home. Guelph. 50 Km away.

^ Eventually, we put Justin in a van and drove him back home.

^ We walked nearly 8Km that night.

^ 20 years later, I still remember this day as though it was yesterday

^ Why? Because I was _way_ out of my comfort zone.

^ I was...

^ Time for some reflection

^ Think back to one of your most vivid memories. Good, or bad.

^ Chances are, this memory was formed by a situation where you were uncomfortable

^ New experiences, challenging times, a time where you were out of your comfort zone.
